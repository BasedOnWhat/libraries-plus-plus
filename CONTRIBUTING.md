# Intro

Welcome to the contributing guide! Here you will find the guidelines for contributing. Whether it be source, documenting, or more. The style is somewhat arbitrary, but it should be reasonable.


# Libraries++ Source Contributing Guide

* Use `snake_case` for variable, parameter, etc. names
* Individual  functions belong as a submodule of their parent library (e.g join should be a child module of string)
